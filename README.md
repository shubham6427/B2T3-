Hello I am Shubham Tiwari happy for sharing this details about Assigned Project.
This project is done under a team work, where I have lead the team and the team membars are Piyush Hiraoo, Divya Mishra, and Ranu Soni.
This project is based on post office order management system where the user/consumer can save his money and time as well with the help of this website.
This website will help the user to track his post through the track consignment where he know about his post is delivered or not also it will helps for tracking the post location through that we know how much that post is covered its distance from starting to final destination.
With the help of this website user/consumer can raise his complain on Complain page if he facing any type of issue in his post or delivery.
